### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a highly motivated 14-year-old from Austria with a deep passion for programming, problem-solving, and real-world tech projects. I love learning complex technologies and applying them to build tools, dashboards, games, and automation scripts that actually *do something useful*.

- 🧠 Constantly learning: **Node.js**, **Python**, **React**, **FastAPI**, **MongoDB**
- 🚀 Big focus on **full-stack development**, **real-time systems**, and **data analysis**
- 🛠️ Currently working on several projects to sharpen my portfolio and get future experience
- 🔍 Open for voluntary project collaboration, mentorship, or internships
